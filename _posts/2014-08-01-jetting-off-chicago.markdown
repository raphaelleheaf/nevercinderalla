I've spoilt myself with holidays this year. Austin, Tokyo, and now Chicago!

I made some wonderful friends when I stayed in an [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/) in Austin (it's one of the additional benefits to staying with locals) and we all decided to meet up again for this year's [Lollapalooza](http://www.lollapalooza.com/). What better excuse to visit somewhere new.

###Music in the Windy City

Sunshine, city and a lake so big it's like being by a gentle sea.

It's a pretty good location to enjoy a festival. Catching a bit of Churches, discovering some new bands, such as [The Last Internationale](http://www.thelastinternationale.com/) and rocking out with a lot of Eminem + a guest appearance of Rheanna. What's not to love!

And of course, plenty of opportunity for some festival fashion, as well as showing off my new tattoos.

Necklaces from J.Crew & thanks to [Blowtique](http://www.blowtique.com/) for my last minute appointment to glam me up.

###Wandering the city

Chicago is a great city. It's easy to explore, get about and there's lots to visit. I got a [Citypass](http://www.citypass.com/chicago?mv_source=rkg&creative=53482547789&adpos=1t1&device=c&network=g&matchtype=e&gclid=CMXNwZrkq8ACFRHHtAod6hAAYg) and in two days ran around and managed to use all the tickets. [Uber](https://www.uber.com/invite/qtjwq) was quick, easy and cheap to use but walking around the city is a joy.
