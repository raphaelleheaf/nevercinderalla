I was inspired by the best Old Fashioned I've ever had at [Untitled Supper Club](http://untitledchicago.com/home-page/) in Chicago to get into making my own cocktails. As soon as I got home, I splashed out and bought some very nice alcohol, some good books and rather fancy cocktail set from [Alexander & James](http://www.alexanderandjames.com/gift-sets/alexander-and-james-cocktail-making-set-cocktailset.html?start=15&cgid=gift-sets). 

Fancy joining me? Here's a selection of what I've been up to.

##Aviation (with Aviation Gin no less)
