Breakups are hard. This isn't about drowning my spirits in the bottom of a glass. Cocktails should always be a delight to make and be enjoyed positively. In fact that Christmas I spent on my own, curled up on the sofa with gratin Dauphinois.  
What it did do was bring me closer to my older brother. The following Christmas I went to spend with him and his family. It was he first time I'd spent Christmas with my young neice and nephew. That really does add so much excitement and smiles to the day.  
To say the least my sister-in-law was keen to ensure I was relaxed and looked after. As I arrived she quickly served up this simple classic and for the next four days ensured I was reguarly topped up.

Although this is a great cocktail for Christmas, the spiced bitters and warming brandy fit nicely into winter months, it's so easy to make there's no reason you can't enjoy it all year round.
