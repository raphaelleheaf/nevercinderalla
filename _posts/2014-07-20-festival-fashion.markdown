Yesterday, I was at [Lovebox Festival](http://loveboxfestival.com/). We danced all afternoon to Dimitri and Crystal Fighters, chilled out to Bonobo and rounded the evening off with a great set from M.I.A.
Unlike the weather forecast, it was hot and sunny all day. So, here's how I styled myself.

##Black crop top & grey spliced skirt from Topshop

##Trainers Superga with JCrew in silver with sparkly ankle socks from Tabio
