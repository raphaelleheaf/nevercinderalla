Well, this is me.

30 something, single and not your perfect 10 (or 8, or 6). Weight has always been an issue. Being half-french means I've been gifted with curves, but only around my bottom and hips. In fact I probably tell people I'm 5'4" and 60kg, on a bad day, I'm more liek 5'3" and 70kg on a good day.

I really trully dislike exercise. I'm aiming for 4 times per week, although I'm lucky if it's twice and for some insane reason deicded to enter a 10k. It's total hell.

I've spent my life feeling like I was never quite perfect enough. And now I look back at pictures of when I was 18 and think about how much time I wasted, wanting to be thinner. Some things don't change.

#Why start this?
