Sunday evening, listening to Kasabian Live at Glasonbury. 
Sat on the sofa I'm just missing a good glass of wine or gin & tonic. 

I've eaten half a bowl of pea & mint soup for dinner. It's my new cold turkey to keep the calories low. Although, I did have a single poached eggs royale for brunch, over which I debate with a friend whether I was really kidding myself about having an active lifestyle. Maybe he had a point, but just because I'm not running every day doesn't make me a sloth, deos it? I could be worse.

And here I am. 11:30pm, calorie counting.

No, it's not another bikini-ready summer diet. One that ask you to cut carbs and sugar and dairy and basically everything you start to dream about. 

The truth is I'm 5'4", and taking the word curvy to the slight extreme. I'm aiming to lose 15kg in order to actually be the weight I should be. 
That's a lot! And it's been two years that I've been trying to shift it. But day two of my new healthy eating and I can see my waist is coming back. Enough to wear a long black dress that clings a bit, but also shows off my new tattoos. At least I can sometimes find clothes that I don't lack confindence in.

So, this is me. 32 this year. Single. Curvy. Realising that I'll never quite be a Disney Cinderella but maybe I can find a better role model for the modern day fairy-tale to happen.
