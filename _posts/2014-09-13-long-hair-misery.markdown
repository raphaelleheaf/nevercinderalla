I've had long hair now for the best part of 20 years (following a childhood of a classic french bob). It's taken me a while to get my hair care right. My hair has suffered from the curling and striaghtening and endless highlighting or colours I've put it through. But I could never cut it off.

It's every girl's morning nightmare. You were out, you were busy or let's face it, the days when you just can't be bothered. You fell asleep with your hair up in that scrunchie. And now rather than bed head tossled look you can pass off as trendy, you wake up to a matted mess.

###Two things. 

First. Don't wash it! Long hair suffers from being washed too much anyway. The water will only cause you to look like your trying to create one massive dreadlock.

Second. Don't just try and go at it with your biggest brush. You'll not only have tears from the pain but you'll lose half your hair.

###Top products you need in your cupboard

There's a few things on the market that will help rescue your lovely locks:

[MaroccanOil](http://www.lookfantastic.com/brands/moroccanoil.list). Never leave home without it. I love using a little bit daily to keep my hair sleek and frizz-free. 
[Cowboy Magic](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=cowboy+magic&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acowboy+magic). A serum for the mane of my lovely equine friend, actually works wonders on your own hair too.
[Phyto Nourishing Cream](http://www.feelunique.com/p/Phyto-9-Daily-Ultra-Nourishing-Botanical-Cream-50ml). Not only will this help tidy up those knots, but wil make your hair feel alive again.
[Pylia Leave-in Conditioner](http://www.victoriahealth.com/product/Condition-Cream-Rinse-or-Leave-In/9959/brand/Phylia-de-M/864). Not cheap but you don't need to use a lot to restore your hair back to it's full glosiness.
