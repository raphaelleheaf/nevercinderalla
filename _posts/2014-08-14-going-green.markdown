I've enjoyed doing a few raw juice diets and particularly love [Raw & Juicy](http://www.raw-and-juicy.com/). I'll also post soon about my favourite juice bars soon.

In the mean time, I also wanted to be able to make my own green juices in the morning. I invested in getting myself a [big glass mixer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00G4CYA8G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0) just off Amazon. It's given me the kick I needed to be healthier and now every morning I make up a fresh juice to get me going.
