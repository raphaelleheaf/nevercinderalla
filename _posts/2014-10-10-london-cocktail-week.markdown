It turns out that if you start getting into making cocktails, that you probably want to end up going to a week in your home town dedicated to mixology; [London Cocktail Week](http://www.londoncocktailweek.com/). My recent cocktail blogging got me a Trade wristband, so it would have been rude to not take full advantage of what was on offer.

Hundreds of pop ups were all over the city. Along with the many tastings, workshops, competitions, talks and masterclases, it certainly felt like a week was probably not enough time to discover it all. 

##Here were my highlights

With hubs across the city, it's important to pick an area for the evening and stay there.
Covent Garden was my favourite. 


![Bulleit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphaelleheaf/nevercinderella/gh-pages/_assets/bulleit.jpg)  
From the Bulleit 1950s bar at the [Covent Garden Cocktail Club](http://coventgardencocktailclub.co.uk/).  


![Martini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphaelleheaf/nevercinderella/gh-pages/_assets/martini.jpg)  
To The Whiskey Exchange creating a the best Martini I've ever tasted and introducing me to [Mirto](http://www.nifeislife.com/mirto-sardegna-70cl-p-2021.html).  


![Love Child](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphaelleheaf/nevercinderella/gh-pages/_assets/love_child.jpg)  
And the very awesomely named, _Berlusconi Love Child_ (a mix of Monkey Shoulder whiskey, Amaro & Crème de Pêche) at the Monkey Shoulder popup, The Cowbell, which also had amazing Glaswegian Djs setting the party vibe.  



If you love cocktails, what's not to love about this week. All round be prepared to not make it home till late, but rest assured that your tastebuds will be well and trully satisfied.
